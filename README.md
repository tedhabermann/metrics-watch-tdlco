# metrics-watch

**Automatic metadata metrics for DataCite repositories.** Fork this repository,
name your repositories in one config file, and a scheduled GitHub Action scores
their metadata against the [Metadata Game Changers use
cases](https://metadata-game-changers.github.io/recuration-watch/useCases.html)
every month — committing the reports here and publishing a trend page, with no
server and nothing to install.

It is the automation companion to the [MGC Repository
Tools](https://metadata-game-changers.github.io/recuration-watch/): the scorer
runs the same jq queries over the same DataCite API sampling rules as the
[Metadata Completeness](https://metadata-game-changers.github.io/recuration-watch/completeness.html)
web tool, and writes the same report files — so automated runs, web-tool
downloads, and the MGC score archive all speak one format.

## Set up your own (about two minutes)

1. **Fork** this repository (button at the top right).
2. On your fork, open the **Actions** tab and click **"I understand my workflows,
   go ahead and enable them"** (GitHub disables workflows on forks until you opt in).
3. Still in **Actions**, click **Score metadata** in the left sidebar — if a banner
   says the scheduled workflow is disabled, click **Enable workflow** (GitHub also
   switches off *schedules* in forks until you opt in).
4. Edit [`config.json`](config.json): list your repository ids (the DataCite
   *client id*, e.g. `sjyq.oozvia` — find yours by searching your repository name
   in any of the web tools), or set `"consortium"` to a DataCite consortium id to
   score every member repository.
5. Optionally, run it now: **Actions → Score metadata → Run workflow**.
   Otherwise the schedule takes it from there (monthly by default — see below).
6. Optionally, publish the trend page: **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a
   branch**, then choose branch `main` and folder **`/docs`** and Save. The page
   appears at `https://<you>.github.io/<fork-name>/` — with the `/docs` folder
   selected it is served at the site root, no `/docs` suffix needed. (If you pick
   `/ (root)` instead, the page lives at `…/<fork-name>/docs/`.)

Each run commits its results, so the repository accumulates a public, versioned
history of your metadata's improvement.

### config.json

The simple form scores everything on one schedule:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `repositories` | list of DataCite client ids to score |
| `consortium` | a DataCite consortium id — adds every member repository |
| `schedule` | `daily`, `weekly` (Mondays), or `monthly` (the 1st — the default) |
| `max` | records sampled per repository (default 500) |
| `random` | `true` for a random sample; `false` for most-recent records |
| `resourceType` | optional DataCite resource-type-id filter (e.g. `dataset`) |
| `query` | optional DataCite query filter — filtered runs form their own series |

The config may carry `// line` and `/* block */` comments — handy for noting why
a set exists or parking a repository you'll add later. (Editors may underline
them since strict JSON has no comments; the scorer accepts them regardless.)

### Sets: different repositories, queries, and schedules in one fork

For anything beyond one uniform watch, replace the flat keys with `"sets"` —
each set has its own schedule and defaults, and each repository entry can be a
plain client id or an object with its own filters:

```json
{
  "sets": [
    { "name": "texas", "schedule": "monthly", "consortium": "tdlco", "max": 5000 },
    { "name": "recuration-project", "schedule": "weekly", "max": 1000,
      "repositories": [
        "iris.iris",
        { "client": "iris.iris", "query": "types.resourceTypeGeneral:Dataset", "label": "datasets" }
      ] }
  ]
}
```

- **Different queries against the same repository are monitored separately**:
  each query (or explicit `label`) gets its own report files, its own history,
  its own trend-page section, and its own viewer link — series never mix.
- **One repository, many queries** — give the set a `"queries"` list and it
  cross-multiplies with the set's repositories (and consortium members). Entries
  are query strings or `{ "query": …, "label": … }` objects; an empty string
  `""` keeps the plain whole-repository series alongside the filtered ones.
  A repository entry that carries its **own** `query` is excluded from the
  cross-product — it stays exactly the one series it asked for:

  ```json
  { "name": "iris-slices", "repositories": ["iris.iris"],
    "queries": ["", "types.resourceTypeGeneral:Dataset",
                { "query": "publicationYear:2025", "label": "y2025" }] }
  ```

- **One query, many repositories** — the set-level `"query"` (or a one-entry
  `"queries"` list) applies to every repository in the set:

  ```json
  { "name": "datasets", "query": "types.resourceTypeGeneral:Dataset",
    "repositories": ["tdl.tamu", "tdl.utl"] }
  ```

- **Schedules are per set**: an active re-curation project can run `daily` or
  `weekly` while the rest of your repositories stay `monthly`. (Under the hood
  the Action wakes daily and scores only the sets due that day; the manual
  **Run workflow** button always scores every set.)
- **A set can be a whole consortium**: give it `"consortium"` instead of (or as
  well as) `repositories`, and every member repository joins the set.
- Set-level `max` / `random` / `resourceType` / `query` are defaults for that
  set's repositories; entry-level values override them.
- Every run publishes **`docs/sets.json`**, and the trend page links each set
  into the suite's [Set Viewer](https://metadata-game-changers.github.io/recuration-watch/setViewer.html)
  — a radar grid of all members for one run, bright spots first.

### Watching many things — or making more repositories like this one

One fork covers many repositories, many query series, and many schedules via
sets, and that is usually all you need. GitHub allows only **one fork per
account**, so if you want fully independent copies (say, one per project or
department), use **Use this template** on this repository's front page instead
of forking — template copies are unlimited and independent. The tradeoff:
copies have no **Sync fork** button, so they don't receive upstream
improvements (set them up once and let them run).

## What a run produces

```
reports/<client-id>/<stem>_useCaseReport__YYYY-MM-DDThh.json   one snapshot per run
reports/<client-id>/<stem>_useCaseHistory.json                 every run of the series, concatenated
docs/index.html                                                trend page over all series
```

`<stem>` is the client id, plus a filter-derived label when `resourceType` or
`query` is set, so filtered series never mix with whole-repository series.
Snapshots are canonical; the history file is re-derived from them on every run.

The snapshot JSON is exactly what the Metadata Completeness web tool's
**⬇ Data (JSON)** button downloads — `{repository: {…run stats, fairTotal,
projectsTotal, shareTotal}, useCases: [{code, title, average, items: [{concept,
completeness}]}]}` — and the history file matches the MGC score-archive format,
so existing MGC tooling reads both.

## Running locally

Requires python3 (standard library only) and [jq](https://jqlang.org/download/)
(`brew install jq` on macOS; preinstalled on GitHub's ubuntu runners).

```
python3 scoreRepository.py --client sjyq.oozvia
python3 scoreRepository.py --consortium oaem --max 200
python3 scoreRepository.py --config config.json
python3 makeTrendPage.py
```

## What does it look like in practice?

[`example/`](example/) holds a real history file from the IRIS seismology
repository, captured during an active 2025 re-curation project — FAIR total
climbing from 11% to 37% run by run.

## Updating your fork

Improvements to the scorer, the trend page, and the use-case catalog land in
this upstream repository — they do **not** reach your fork automatically. Your
fork's front page shows a **Sync fork** button whenever upstream has news: one
click merges the updates. Your `config.json` and accumulated `reports/` are
yours alone (upstream never changes them after setup), so syncing is normally
conflict-free.

## Good to know

- **The Action wakes daily but only commits when a set is due** — quiet days
  produce a short run with "Nothing due today" and no commit.
- **Scheduled workflows pause after ~60 days without repository activity.**
  Each run's commit counts as activity, so a healthy setup keeps itself alive —
  but if runs start failing silently, GitHub will eventually email you to
  re-enable the schedule. Glance at the Actions tab now and then.
- **Scores are current-state.** Every run samples records *as they are that
  day* — so a rising line means your re-curation is working, whichever year the
  records were registered.
- **Sampling noise.** With `max` 500 against a large repository, totals move a
  point or two run-to-run from sampling alone. Use `"random": false` for small
  repositories (≤ max) to score every record deterministically.
- **The use-case catalog** ([`FAIR_spirals.json`](FAIR_spirals.json)) is copied
  from the [recuration-watch](https://github.com/Metadata-Game-Changers/recuration-watch)
  suite — update it from there when the use cases evolve.
